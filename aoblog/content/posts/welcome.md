I am a PhD student in bioinformatics. I planned to build my Github pages since few times... Now, I managed to do it !

### To do list

* add a Github logo in the top right corner with a link to my Github account
* move the light/dark mode button in the top right corner
* build a nice first page
* on the top, add two menus : vignettes and/or posts and/or other topics
